# Elon Musk Tribute Page

As a big fan of Elon Musk, especially Tesla and SolarCity (I know, it's a part of Tesla now but I love the idea of using sustainable energy), I decided to use his accomplishments as a content to create a website based on a CSS framework - Bootstrap.

## Technologies used

* CSS
* Bootstrap
* SCSS
* JSON
* Gulp

## Idea

It was the very first website I have created as a project for [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-tribute-page).


The idea was to practice the framework and create a simple single page on a chosen topic.
